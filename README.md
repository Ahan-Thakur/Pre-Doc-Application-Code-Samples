# Pre-Doc-Application-Code-Samples

Each folder on the main branch is associated with a different project
The programming languages for which there are samples are written in brackets in each folder name 

# Development Accounting
Replicating a simplified version of Caselli's (2004) "Accounting for Cross-Country Income Differences" paper. The code:
- Puts together the production function & estimates residual TFP
- Estimates the "Measure of Our Ignorance", both across all countries and countries at different percentiles, using log-variance decomposition
- Generates scatter plots

Completed in Undergraduate Year 1

# UG Year-3 Dissertation
Estimating the causal effect of institutional change on the proximate causes of growth. (WIP) The code:
- Cleans the V-Dem and PWT datasets & merges them
- Puts together the production function & estimates residual TFP
- Generates plots of the time series for various countries 
- Runs a simple DiD regression of institutional change on log capital per capita 

Work in Progress
